#How to use the codebook to pick your variables
#V3HRS0: How many hours did you spend in the past month working for {name of 1st organization}
#RACE_ETH: -8 is missing, -7 is missing, 1 is Spanish/Hispanic/Latino, 2 is non-Hispanic black, and 3 is non-Hispanic/non-black
#I want to recode the -8's and -7's as missing and combine 1's and 2's to a single level
#Assumptions of an independent samples t-test:
#1: The two groups should be two unrelated (independent) groups
#(i.e. members of one groups cannot be members of another, an individual cannot be classified as more than one category, in the context of my data you can't be both non-Hispanic/non-black and Spanish/Hispanic/Latino/non-Hispanic black)
#One of your variables will be categorical (only two levels besides the missing data) and one will be continuous (five or more levels besides the missing data)
#Arguments can be made that likert variables are ordinal, but for the purposes of this paper we will say they are continuous
#2: The dependent variable (residuals) must be approximately normally distributed
#3: We assume homogeneity of variance of the two unrelated groups
#This means that the variance of each of the groups should be approximately equal in the population

#On average, the sample contained people who drove under the speed limit (M = 63.00, SD = 5.43). The average speed for females was (M = 60.35, SD = 4.44) while the average speed for males was (M = 70.98, SD = 3.87).
#There was a significant effect of gender on speed, t(38) = 5.98, p = .02.
#OR
#There was a significant effect of age on voting preference, t(38) = 5.98, p < .05.
