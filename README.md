## The Relationship between Household Income and Volunteerism in Relation to Relatives / Non-Household Members

PSC 103a Final Project

The balance of gaining wealth and yet giving back is a common trouble for many people
in the workforce, and especially so within the rise in new college graduates now exposed to work
hours, labor force participation, a need for productivity at work, attractiveness of a career
mindset, and a steady income (Hamilton, 2012). Often, a higher income stems from time spent
toiling away at work--thus, less time is spent elsewhere and therefore, a cutback in personal life
in relationships and serving others. In addition, the possession of wealth can produce either a
greedy or giving personality. Because wealth and income can influence altruism, and with the
relevance to the millions people working within the United States, within this paper I aim to see
the relationship between household income and volunteering for relatives / non-household
members.

Various studies show of how the demands of a higher income, resulting from a high
amount of hours required to be a productive and high ranking employee, entails a cutback in
generosity, altruism, and overall social and personal lives. With more time at work comes with a
greater work-life conflict, as less time is spent in developing relationships and volunteering time
to serve others in the community. One study, specifically targeting working dads and their
work-life balance, revealed that approximately a majority of working dads agree to the
assumption that the most productive employees in the workforce are those who put work ahead
of personal and family lives, as well as the assumption that most employees are expected to work
a minimum of 50 hours/week (Harrington, Fraone & Lee, 2017).

However, many studies have also shown of how an increase in income comes with an
increase in volunteerism, giving a contrary claim to the one above. This relates to the age old
question of whether money increases happiness--and thus, often a greater heart to serve and aid
others. For example, a higher income gives higher amounts of comfort and flexibility in way of
life and thus, greater life satisfaction overall; there is enough to support own needs as well as
give to others who are in need. This is expressed in that participation in volunteer deeds
increases with income, even after controlling for observables (Pho, 2008). In relation to the
greater work hours associated with higher income, one study argues of how although the rising
demands of work raises concerns of time devoted to interpersonal relationships and
volunteerism, participants were able to create strategies for connecting the bridge between
friends / family and work as a result of flexible employer-employee working relationships and
easy communication through technology (Moen & Flood, 2013). Lastly, volunteerism is seen as
a psychosocial resource contributing to a greater sense of work-life balance for people in the
workforce--that those working in high-paying jobs still volunteer a generous amount, for giving
back is associated to less work-life conflict, burnout and stress, and a better positive mental
health (Ramos et al., 2016). Because of these differing conclusions in studies, instead of
hypothesizing a relationship that is directional, I hypothesize that there is a difference in
household income of those who did not volunteer time to help non-household relatives /
members compared to those who did volunteer time to help non-household relatives / members.
